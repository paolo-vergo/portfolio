        "Project Overview": "This project focuses on monitoring the health of various government applications by taking live metrics such as latency and performance. Using machine learning techniques like classical statistics, nonparametric methods, and LSTM models, we predict the evolution of these metrics over the short to medium-term. The goal is to forecast potential issues or faults with a time lag, providing early warnings to technicians for timely intervention.",
        "Key Features": "The system tracks live service metrics, performs predictive modeling on time series data, and displays the results on an intuitive dashboard. Alerts are triggered when potential faults are predicted, helping technicians to act proactively.",
        "Techniques Used": "Classical time series analysis, nonparametric methods, LSTM for time series forecasting, real-time data processing, and dynamic dashboard updates for visualization.",
        "Outcome": "The project ensures high reliability for government applications by anticipating problems before they affect users, providing a seamless user experience and minimizing downtime."
