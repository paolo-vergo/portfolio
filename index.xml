      <description>Conformal Prediction for regression allows to build valid prediction sets with marginal coverage guarantee of level 1-Î±.
During my thesis I tackled two cases:
 multivariate responses functional responses  For each one of the frameworks I built an R package:
 conformalInference.multi conformalInference.fd  Both packages have submitted and are now available on CRAN!
The full code can be found on the following github repositories:

      <description>Description We modeled the logarithm of the daily increase in closing prices of the stocks of Astrazeneca, Johnson&amp;amp;Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer on the yearly period ending on April 25th, 2021.
In particular we used:
 Augmented Dickey Fuller test ARMA modelling Model selection with AIC, BIC One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov non-parametric test for normality Ljung-Box Q-test GARCH modelling EGARCH modelling Comparison of forecasting performances with MAE and MSE  Project report In the repository, the full report of the project, containing all the references and a complete discussion of the modelling choices is available in Project Description.</description>

      <description>These are 3 independent projects on CNN developed with Python using Tensorflow.
Structure  Multiclass image classification (mainly using Transfer Learning) Image Segmentation, using a patch based mechanism with U-Net VQA combing an image feature extractor with an attention Mechanism  For each project the code versions for Windows/Linux and for OSX are included.

      <description>It is a CPP implementend version of Gibbs Sampler for the following Hierarchical Dirichlet Mixture Model:
 It was designed in order to carry out a task of functional smoothing for grouped data, in particular to estimate the step functional component of sport performances data contained in the Shotput Dataset. Please refer to the Project Report for details about context and further research.

      <description>I just graduated from the MSc. in Mathematical Engineering - Statistical Learning in Politecnico di Milano.
Having a strong mathematical background I enjoy tackling complex problems and trying to understand their inner logics. At the same time I enjoy programming : in fact my master thesis was focused on the constructions of R packages.
Overall I like the data science world for its variety and the opportunity to study a diverse array of data and models in a creative way.</description>
